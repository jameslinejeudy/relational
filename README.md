In-Memory Database with Transaction Support
This project implements an in-memory key-value database with transaction support in C++.

Overview
Transactions in databases ensure atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties) for data manipulation. This database system is designed to maintain these properties while supporting key-value pairs in an in-memory environment. It allows users to perform operations within a transaction and commit or rollback changes accordingly.

Usage
Running the Code
To run the code:

Clone this repository.
Open your preferred C++ compiler or IDE.
Compile the code.
Execute the compiled binary.
Example using GCC compiler:

bash
Copy code
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
Ensure any necessary dependencies or headers are accessible within your build environment.

Future Improvements
To evolve this project into an official assignment, several enhancements can be considered:

Comprehensive Error Handling: Include detailed error messages for various scenarios to aid users and developers in understanding issues.
Test Suite Implementation: Develop a robust test suite to cover different functionalities and edge cases, ensuring the database's reliability.
Expanded Functionality: Extend the database to handle more complex queries, support additional data types, or introduce more advanced transactional features.
Documentation & Comments: Enhance code documentation and comments to provide clarity on the implementation and logic behind different methods and functionalities.
Performance Optimization: Explore ways to optimize the database for better efficiency, especially with larger datasets or high transactional loads.
These modifications would make the assignment more comprehensive, user-friendly, and aligned with industry standards.
